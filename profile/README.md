## 📘 Engineering Knowledge Base (start here)

The **Aalberts Digital Buildings Knowledge Base** is the central, version-controlled source of truth
for Digital Buildings engineering knowledge.

👉 **[Aalberts Digital Buildings Knowledge Base](https://github.com/aalbertshfc/aalberts-digital-buildings-knowledge-base)**

It contains:
- System and platform architecture
- Device landscape and ownership
- Communication protocols (LoRaWAN, Modbus, MQTT, …)
- OTA, bootloader and recovery procedures
- Integration patterns (southbound / northbound)
- Architectural decision records (ADRs)

**Information not documented there should not be treated as authoritative.**

---

## What we do
- **Connected hydronic devices**: Thermostatic heads, sensors, and embedded control platforms.
- **Digital building integration**: EMS/BMS connectivity and interoperability.
- **Energy management systems**: Monitoring, control, and optimization of thermal energy assets.
---

## Projects

- **[LoRaWAN thermostatic devices](https://github.com/search?q=topic%3Alrch+org%3Aaalbertshfc&type=Repositories)** &rarr; Connected radiator control and telemetry.

- **[Smart Heat Vault Controller Testing Tool](https://github.com/search?q=topic%3Ashvc+org%3Aaalbertshfc&type=Repositories)**  &rarr; Monitoring and control of thermal storage systems.

---

## Engineering principles
- **Source of truth in Git**: Documentation is versioned and reviewed.
- **Device-first architecture**: Systems are designed from field constraints upward.
- **Interoperability by design**: Preference for open and documented protocols.
- **Docs are a feature**: ADRs and runbooks are mandatory for critical changes.
- **Decisions are traceable**: Major technical choices are documented with context and rationale (ADRs).
---

## How to contribute
1. Start with the **Engineering Knowledge Base**.
2. Changes go through Pull Requests.
3. Major technical decisions require an ADR.
4. Keep documentation close to implementation and kept up to date.
